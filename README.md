# Cheapest_Electrical_Vehicles
Summary of the project and background:
Using a dataset that includes characteristics like battery range, charging time, and
manufacturer, this study seeks to examine the variables affecting the cost of reasonably priced
electric vehicles (EVs). The study determines the main factors influencing EV prices by using
regression, classification, and clustering models. The results give manufacturers and
policymakers insight into how affordability is influenced by performance and brand. By
emphasizing important elements for pricing optimization, the initiative aids in understanding
market dynamics and eventually promotes wider EV adoption.
Research Question:
What are the key factors influencing the price of the most affordable electric cars, and how do
these factors vary across different models and manufacturers?
Project Objective:
This project's goal is to use machine learning techniques to examine the main factors
affecting the cost of affordable electric vehicles (EVs). The goal of the study is to find
important pricing predictors by examining the connections between attributes including
brand, charging time, and battery range. By comprehending market realities, these insights
can help manufacturers optimize EV designs for affordability and assist policymakers in
encouraging wider EV adoption. The results will aid in closing the performance-price gap,
increasing customer access to electric vehicles.
